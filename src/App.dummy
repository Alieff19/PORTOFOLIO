// Import generated images (make sure filenames match what was generated/renamed)
// Since I can't know the exact filenames of generated images without listing, 
// I will assume I need to rename them or allow the user to see generic imports first.
// Wait, I know the filenames because I just generated them. 
// However, the tool output gave them timestamps. I should find them first or just import them if I knew the names.
// Better approach: I will list the directory first to get exact filenames before writing App.jsx.
// Abort write, list dir first.
